How to get started
=====

#.  Before using Deep-LASI on your single-molecule data, first, make sure you have an 
    installed MATLAB and a working Python environment on your computer system. Alternatively,
    you can also use a MATLAB Runtime environment. You can find 
    a description of the individually required installation steps in the :doc:`installation` guide.

#.  Next, download the Deep-LASI software package from the `Software Repository <https://gitlab.com/simon71/deeplasi>`_ and/or add the MATLAB source code to the working folder of your MATLAB installation.

#.  Before running Deep-LASI for the first time, have a look at the :doc:`example`, which provide a step-wise description of how to load single-molecule data into the software. Example data sets are provided.

#. To follow the examples cases, download the corresponding data sets and save/copy them into your analysis folder. Data from `Wanninger et al. (2023) <https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.31.526220>`_ is publicly available on Zenodo. Demo Data sets can be further downloaded from the `Repository <https://gitlab.com/simon71/deeplasi>`_.
